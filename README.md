# ProsePlay

A tool for creating interactive sliding texts.

This project is in early development, so things will probably be breaking and changing. I am also in early development as an open source maintainer, but I’m excited to figure out how to make this a tool that people can use and adapt. I’d love to collaborate with people in improving and expanding the API — feel free to open an issue or reach out to me with any questions or ideas!

## Usage

Install ProsePlay:

```
npm install proseplay
```

In your project, import the library:

```
import { ProsePlay } from "proseplay";
